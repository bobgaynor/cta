    "# Cyber Threat Analyzer (CTA) - Part 1: Finding the Signal in the Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Ingest raw system log data, parse it into a structured format using Pandas and Regex, enrich it with threat intelligence from the AbuseIPDB API, and prepare it for exploratory data analysis (EDA).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"Why\"\n",
    "Raw log files are 99% routine system chatter or what we'll call \"audio static\". Hidden inside that noise is the 1% that truly matters: the \"signal.\" This signal is our actionable intelligence - the failed logins, the weird connections, the real threats. The purpose of this notebook is to build the automatic noise filter. We'll use data engineering to turn that \"wall of noise\" into a clean, actionable signal, building the foundation for our ML model."
